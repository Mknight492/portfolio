Hi my name's Mike, I'm a self taught web developer.

This is my portfolio page I'm working on where I hope to eventually link other projects to.

I'm currently trying to learn the 'full-stack' and so far have learnt the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- Javascript ES2015/ES.Next
- Webpack
- Git + GitHub (obviously)
- C#
- .Net Core

and I'm looking to learn:

- React
- Jest
- AWS/Azure

Would love to hear from you.
